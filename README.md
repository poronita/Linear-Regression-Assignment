## General Information
The project revolves around addressing the business challenges faced by BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, BoomBikes experienced a decline in revenue. The company is keen on developing a strategic business plan to thrive in the post-lockdown period and understand the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes.

<b> Business Problem:</b>
The primary business problem is to model and predict the demand for shared bikes. BoomBikes aims to identify the significant variables affecting bike demand, comprehend the dynamics of demand, and prepare a business strategy accordingly. The objective is to enhance revenue by meeting customer expectations and distinguishing themselves from other service providers.

<b>Dataset:</b>
The dataset used for analysis contains information on daily bike demands across the American market. The dataset includes various features such as weather conditions, seasons, months, weekdays, and more. The target variable, 'cnt,' represents the total number of bike rentals. The company has gathered this data to explore the factors influencing bike demand and to build a predictive model for future demand scenarios.

In the project, we will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and build a multiple linear regression model. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the model's performance will be evaluated. Recommendations based on the analysis will be provided to assist BoomBikes in adapting their business strategy for optimal results.
